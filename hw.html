        <h2>BaseBall</h2>
        <p>Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each, taking turns batting and fielding. The
        game occurs over the course of several plays, with each play beginning when a player on the fielding team, called the
        pitcher, throws a ball that a player on the batting team, called the batter, tries to hit with a bat. The objective of
        the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, away from the other team's players,
        allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called
        "runs". The objective of the defensive team (referred to as the fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming
        runners, and to prevent runners advancing around the bases. A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the
        bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter).</p>

        <h2>Basketball</h2>
        <p>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams of five players each (excluding subs), opposing one another on a
        rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in
        diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.05 m) high to a
        backboard at each end of the court). Teams alternate between offense, when they attempt to score, and defense, when they
        try to prevent the opposing side from scoring. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point
        line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical
        foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if
        regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated. However, if the
        additional period still results in a tied score, yet another additional period is mandated. This goes on until the score
        is not tied anymore.</p>
